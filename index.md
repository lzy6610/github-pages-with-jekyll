I'm glad you are here. I plan to share the week 1 writing from STA303

Week 1 writing

Before taking any university courses, I thought most statisticiansâ€™ jobs would be studying and
analyzing the data for banks and companies using statistics and mathematics. I did not have any
idea on what exactly statisticians could accomplish by analyzing the data. Also, the concept and
use of data analyze were very foggy for me. A future career as a statistician was intriguing,
exciting but misty for me entering the university.
However, after a few courses in university, I learned about some different models and some
statistic knowledge. Then, I had a better idea on what statisticians are capable of doing. Also, by
talking to some TAs and some senior schoolmates, I understood that statisticians not only could
solve problems and analyze data using software such as R and SQL, but also were able to make
models to help companies to get a detailed look of certain products in the market based on the
data. Moreover, statisticians were vital for a successful company. In accomplished and large
firms, statisticians would usually have a giant database to work with. Their main jobs would be
making models to predict the likelihood of customers to accept certain products, functions or
projects. For example, an internet company like Instagram would ask their statisticians to make
models bases on their huge database before launching any new functions to their app. In some
new and small companies, statisticians were also important. Since the company was new, it was
important to have a statistician to lay the groundwork to collect data and establish a
comprehensive database for the company. By having statisticians creating a database and collect
data from products, new and small companies would be able to make decisions, design new
products and get an understanding of the market using the data between the customers and their
products in the past. Briefly, statisticians were very impactful and important in companies
nowadays because of their abilities to work with data.
